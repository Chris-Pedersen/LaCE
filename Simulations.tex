\section{Simulations}
\label{sec:sims}

Describe here the simulations, include the initial conditions code (GenIC), 
the code to evolve the fields (MP-Gadget), the different boxes used, 
and the code to extract skewers (fake\_spectra).

Discuss also here the optical depth rescaling, different transfer functions
(if any), and thermal history effects (that will be mostly ignored in this
paper).
