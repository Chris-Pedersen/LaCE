# LyaCosmoParams
Notes on cosmological parameters and Lyman alpha simulations

It now contains different folders:
 - notes: LaTeX file with discussions on parameterizations
 - playground: several (disorganized) Jupyter notebooks to play around
 - setup_simulations: python code to setup grid of hydro simulations
 - lya_cosmo: interface with CAMB, and basic cosmology functions
 - lya_nuisance: modelling of nuisance astrophysics (mean flux, temperature...)
 - user_interface: example of CosmoMC module for the marginalized likelihood
