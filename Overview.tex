\section{Cosmological analyses with the \lya\ forest power spectrum}
\label{sec:over}

In this section we present an overview of the different aspects involved in 
a cosmological analysis of the small scale clustering from the \lya\ forest
power spectrum.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Measurement of the flux power spectrum: calibrate the quasar spectra, 
  fit the quasar continua, measure 2-point functions, covariance matrices 
  and possible contaminants.
 \item \textit{Emulate} the flux power spectrum: using hydrodynamical 
  simulations, build an emulator to translate the measured flux power to 
  constraints on the linear power spectrum of density at the redshift of 
  the measurement ($z \sim 3$).
 \item Cosmological constraints: combine the inferred linear power spectrum
  with external datasets (primarily CMB studies) to constraint the parameters
  of a particular cosmological model.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Measuring the \lya\ correlations}

Skip over continuuming fitting, instrumental details, and so on.
This will not be the main focus of this paper.

Beyond BAO analyses \cite{Bautista2017,duMasdesBourboux2017}, the only 
public results on the clustering of the \lya\ forest are measurements of 
the 1D power spectrum \cite{Croft1998,McDonald2000,McDonald2006} or 
more recently \cite{Viel2013,Palanque-Delabrouille2013,Irsic2017,Walther2018a}.
These are usually presented as band powers measured in different redshift
bins, spanning the redshift $1.8 < z < 5.4$, and covering a broad range of 
scales $0.001 \ikms < \kpar < 0.1 \ikms$. 
A compilation of recent measurements is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dataP1D}.

In most cases, the line of sight wavenumbers are expressed in units of 
inverse velocity, $\ikms$, but other mappings from observed wavelength 
could be used.
When measuring the 3D power, we will also need to define transverse 
wavenumbers, and in this case the natural choice is to use units of 
inverse angles \cite{Font-Ribera2018}.


\subsection{\textit{Emulating} the flux power spectrum}

In order to interpret the measurements, we need to be able to make 
theoretical predictions for the measured correlations, and setup a statistical 
method to compare models and compute constraints on their parameters.  

Due to its non-linear nature, to simulate the \lya\ forest (or flux) power 
spectrum we need to rely on expensive hydrodynamical simulations. 
Each model evaluation requires thousands of CPU hours, what makes a 
\textit{brute-force} approach unfeasible. 

Moreover, the flux power spectrum does not only depend on the density 
clustering, but it also depends on the thermal history of the 
Inter-Galactic Medium (IGM) (see \cite{Walther2018b} for a recent review).
In order to compute robust cosmological constraints, we need to make sure 
that we explore all possible thermal histories, and that we fully marginalize 
over these nuisance parameters.

This large parameter space, and the cost of a single run, makes it impossible 
to run a simulation for each model we want to compare.
A small number of simulations is usually available, and in the past different 
analysis have used different techniques to circumvent this problem: 
a smooth dependence was assumed and fit in \cite{McDonald2005a}; 
a Taylor expansion was used in \cite{Palanque-Delabrouille2013}; 
a Gaussian Process-based \textit{emulator} was used in 
\cite{Walther2018a,Walther2018b}, although in this analysis the cosmological
model was kept fixed and only the thermal history was explored.

Emulators based on Gaussian Processes are an active area of research 
\AFR{cite density emulators}, and it is possible that they will have an 
important role in future \lya\ forest analyses.
However, in this publication we will use the term \textit{emulator} in a broad
sense, to describe any setup to use a finite suite of hydrodynamical 
simulations to make predictions for the flux power spectrum.

The main topic of this paper is to study the parameter degeneracies in this 
type of analyses, and discuss how this might affect the parameterization of 
an emulator for the flux power spectrum.


\subsection{Cosmological constraints}

As we will discuss in the next sections, once we have marginalized over 
the thermal history of the IGM, the flux power spectrum is mostly 
sensitive to the amplitude and slope of the linear power spectrum around 
$k \sim 1 \iMpc$ 
\footnote{As it will be discussed in the next sections, the pivot point 
should be specified in velocity units, $k \sim 0.01 \ikms$.} 
and around $z \sim 3$.
For instance, \cite{McDonald2005a} measured these quantities with 15\% and 
5\% precision respectively.

Changes in other (traditional) cosmological parameters are very degenerate 
with changes in the linear power or in the thermal history. 
For instance, as discussed in \cite{Viel2010} and more recently in 
\cite{Pedersen2018}, at fixed linear power spectrum the effect of massive 
neutrinos is almost indistinguishable from that of $\Omega_m$. 
Another exmaple: at fixed linear power spectrum, and fixed $\Omega_m$, the 
effect of $\Omega_b$ is degenerate with the level of UV background assumed.

One of the peculiarities of \lya\ forest analyses that we will discuss is 
that it covers a redshift range $2 < z < 5$ where the universe was close 
to Einsteint-de Sitter (EdS), i.e., $\Omega_m(z) \sim 1$. 
This means that the growth of structure in this redshift range is almost  
independent of cosmology, and so is the expansion history $H(z)/H_0$.

It is only in combination with external datasets, mainly from CMB experiments,
that we are able to provide constraints on the traditional cosmological 
parameters. 
For instance, by combining our measurement at $k \sim 1 \iMpc$ with the CMB 
constraints on the amplitude and slope of the linear power spectrum at 
$k \sim 0.05 \iMpc$ we get tight constraints on the running of the spectral
index ($\alpha_s$) and on the sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$). 

This approach of emulating only the linear power was used in 
\cite{McDonald2005a}, but recent analyses 
\cite{Palanque-Delabrouille2015,Yeche2017} have attempted instead to 
directly emulate the 6+ traditional parameters of a $\Lambda$-CDM universe. 
We will argue that this might not be the best approach, because of the
following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
 \item As discussed above, the traditional parameters have strong degeneracies
  and this makes the emulator (or Taylor expansion) more challenging. 
 \item In order to break the degeneracies, one needs to adopt priors from 
  CMB experiments, making it more dificult to combine with CMB experiments 
  later without double counting information.
 \item The results are model-dependent, and it is impossible to use them in 
  extended models (curved universe, non-$\Lambda$, different $N_{\rm eff}$...)
  if these were not in the original emulator.
\end{itemize}
