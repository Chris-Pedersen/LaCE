\begin{abstract}
This is an internal document aimed at clarifying the work-flow related to extracting cosmological information 
from the \lya\ forest power spectrum, using emulators and hydrodynamical simulations.
It could be used for an eventual publication, but for now the main goal is to make sure we are all on the
same page, and help build the science case for the 11th DiRAC Call.
Some of this discussion started years ago when I was trying to understand the details of the SDSS-I analyses
by Pat and \uros, and how one would do an equivalent 3D analysis. 
Some of it is from chats with Pat and Simeon in 2016, trying to understand why $H_0$ should not be a
parameter in \lya\ analyses. 
The current version is mostly influenced by discussions with \anze\ in a whiteboard of the Cosmoparticle hub,
and by feedback from Pat on an earlier version of this document.
