\section{Fisher forecasts} \label{sec:fore}

One of the projects that could be done with these simulations is to improve
the current Fisher forecasts for \lya\ forest surveys.
Those for DESI were computed using pretty old simulations, and it would be
good to: a) update the simulations, b) expand the DESI forecasts presented
in \cite{FontRibera2014} and c) provide a public code that can be used to make
forecasts for future surveys.

In this section we will discuss how the same simulations used for the
emulator can be used to setup a Fisher forecast code.
